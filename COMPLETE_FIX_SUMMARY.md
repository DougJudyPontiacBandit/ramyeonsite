## 🔧 Changes Made

### Backend Changes
**File**: `backend/app/kpi_views/online_transaction_views.py`

- **Line 21-24**: Force JWT token usage for `customer_id` (single source of truth)
- **Enhanced logging** for order creation and retrieval

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `frontend/src/components/OrderHistory.vue`

- **Auto-refresh every 30 seconds** to fetch latest orders
- **Silent background refresh** (no loading spinner)
- **Enhanced status update handling**
- **Proper timer cleanup** (no memory leaks)

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test New Order Appears
```
1. Log in as customer
2. Place new order
3. Go to Order History
4. ✅ Order appears immediately!
```

### Test Status Updates
```
1. Customer has pending order
2. POS updates status to "confirmed"
3. Wait 30 seconds (or click Refresh)
4. ✅ Status changes to "confirmed"!
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Order Creation
```
Customer → JWT Token → Backend uses token's user_id → MongoDB → ✅
```

### Order Retrieval
```
Customer → JWT Token → Backend uses token's user_id → MongoDB → ✅
```
**Result**: Same `customer_id` used for both = Orders always found!

### Status Updates
```
Every 30 seconds:
OrderHistory → Fetch from MongoDB → Update local state → UI updates ✅
```
