# ✅ Force Recalculate Promotions on Page Load - FIXED!

**Issue:** Stale promotion discounts not updating after page refresh  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Date:** October 28, 2025

---

## 🐛 The Problem

After fixing the promotion calculation logic:
- ❌ Old promotions applied BEFORE the fix still had wrong discount amounts
- ❌ Refreshing the page didn't recalculate the discount
- ❌ Discount stayed at -₱3.00 instead of updating to -₱10.80

### Why?

When the page loaded, it:
1. Loaded cart items from memory
2. Loaded applied promotions from memory (with OLD discount amount)
3. Displayed the OLD discount without recalculating

The NEW calculation logic was only used when:
- Applying a NEW promotion
- Changing quantities (after the quantity fix)

But NOT when loading existing promotions!

---

## ✅ The Solution

Added automatic recalculation of existing promotions when page loads.

### Changes to `frontend/src/components/Cart.vue`:

#### 1. Added New Method: `recalculateExistingPromotions()`

```javascript
async recalculateExistingPromotions() {
  try {
    console.log('🔄 Recalculating existing promotions...');
    
    // Check if there's an applied promotion
    if (this.appliedPromotion && this.cartItems && this.cartItems.length > 0) {
      console.log('📊 Found applied promotion:', this.appliedPromotion.name);
      console.log('📊 Old discount:', this.promotionDiscount);
      
      // Recalculate the discount based on current cart
      const newDiscount = this.computePromotionDiscount(this.appliedPromotion);
      
      console.log('📊 New discount:', newDiscount);
      
      // Update the promotion discount
      this.promotionDiscount = newDiscount;
      
      // If discount is now 0, remove the promotion
      if (newDiscount === 0) {
        console.log('⚠️ Promotion no longer applies, removing...');
        this.appliedPromotion = null;
        this.promotionDiscount = 0;
      }
      
      console.log('✅ Promotion discount recalculated');
    } else {
      console.log('ℹ️ No applied promotion to recalculate');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error recalculating promotions:', error);
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks if there's an applied promotion
2. Recalculates the discount using current cart items
3. Updates the promotion discount
4. Removes promotion if no longer applicable (discount = 0)

#### 2. Called in `mounted()` Lifecycle

```javascript
async mounted() {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Load active promotions
  try {
    console.log('🎁 Loading active promotions for per-item discounts...');
    await this.getActivePromotions();
    console.log('✅ Active promotions loaded:', this.activePromotions.length);
    
    // Try auto-applying the best promotion on load
    await this.autoApplyBestPromotion();
    
    // NEW: Force recalculate any existing promotions
    console.log('🔄 Recalculating existing promotion discounts...');
    await this.recalculateExistingPromotions();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error loading promotions:', error);
  }
  
  // ... rest of code ...
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Page Load Flow:

```
1. User opens cart page
         ↓
2. Load cart items from localStorage/memory
         ↓
3. Load active promotions
         ↓
4. Auto-apply best promotion (if none applied)
         ↓
5. ✨ NEW: Recalculate existing promotions ✨
   - Get applied promotion
   - Calculate NEW discount using NEW logic
   - Update discount amount
   - Remove if no longer applies
         ↓
6. Display correct discount!
```

### Before vs After:

#### Before This Fix:
```
Page Load:
1. Load cart: 4 Alaska @ ₱27 = ₱108
2. Load promotion: "Drinks Promo" with discount = ₱3.00 (OLD)
3. Display: -₱3.00 ❌ WRONG!
```

#### After This Fix:
```
Page Load:
1. Load cart: 4 Alaska @ ₱27 = ₱108
2. Load promotion: "Drinks Promo" with discount = ₱3.00 (OLD)
3. Recalculate: ₱108 × 10% = ₱10.80 (NEW)
4. Update discount: ₱10.80
5. Display: -₱10.80 ✅ CORRECT!
```
