- ❌ **Wrong Order IDs**: Shows "ORDER-176070618437" instead of "ONLINE-000060"

---

## 🎯 Quick Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Test Page

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/test-orders-api.html`
   (Or wherever your frontend is running)
3. **Click "Run All Tests"**

This will tell you EXACTLY what's wrong!

---

### Step 2: Read the Test Results

The test page will check:
- ✅ Are you logged in?
- ✅ Is the backend running?
- ✅ Can you access your profile?
- ✅ Can you fetch orders?

**Look for RED ❌ errors and follow the solutions shown**

### Step 3: Common Issues & Fixes

#### Issue #1: Not Logged In
**Symptom**: "No token found"

**Fix**:
1. Go to your website login page
2. Log in with your customer account
3. Refresh the test page
4. Run tests again

---

#### Issue #2: Token Expired
**Symptom**: "Token is expired" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Fix**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh page
4. Log in again

---

#### Issue #3: Backend Not Running
**Symptom**: "Backend is down" or "Failed to fetch"

**Fix**:
```bash
# In your backend terminal
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

---

#### Issue #4: Customer ID Mismatch
**Symptom**: "Orders fetched but count is 0"

**Fix**: Run this in Django shell:

```python
from backend.app.database import db_manager

db = db_manager.get_database()

# Find orders by email instead
email = "your@email.com"  # YOUR EMAIL HERE

orders = list(db.online_transactions.find({'customer_email': email}))
print(f"Found {len(orders)} orders for {email}")

if orders:
    print("Order IDs:", [o['_id'] for o in orders])
    print("Customer IDs in orders:", [o['customer_id'] for o in orders])
    
# Find your customer record
customer = db.customers.find_one({'email': email})
if customer:
    print(f"\nYour customer _id: {customer['_id']}")
    
    # Check if they match
    if orders:
        match = customer['_id'] == orders[0]['customer_id']
        print(f"IDs match: {match}")
        
        if not match:
            print("\n⚠️ MISMATCH FOUND!")
            print("This is why orders don't show.")
            print("\nFix: Update orders with correct customer_id")
            
            # Optional: Fix the orders
            fix = input("Fix orders automatically? (yes/no): ")
            if fix.lower() == 'yes':
                for order in orders:
                    db.online_transactions.update_one(
                        {'_id': order['_id']},
                        {'$set': {'customer_id': customer['_id']}}
                    )
                print("✅ Orders updated!")
```

## 🔍 Detailed Debugging (If Quick Fix Doesn't Work)

### Check Backend Logs

**In your backend terminal**, you should see:

```
📦 Fetching order history for customer_id: <ID>
✅ Fetched X orders for customer_id: <ID> (total in DB: X)
```

**If you see ERROR instead**, check:
1. Is the endpoint registered? (Check `backend/app/urls.py`)
2. Is authentication decorator working?
3. Is MongoDB connection active?

---

### Check Frontend Logs

**In browser console (F12)**, you should see:

```
🔍 Attempting to fetch from API endpoint: /api/v1/online/orders/history/
📡 API Response: {success: true, count: X, ...}
✅ Loaded X orders from database
```

**If you see ERROR**, check:
1. Is token being sent? (Network tab → Headers)
2. What's the exact error message?
3. What's the response status code?

---

## 🎯 Verify the Fix

After fixing the issue:

1. **Refresh your Order History page**
2. **You should see**:
   - ✅ Orders appear immediately
   - ✅ Order IDs are ONLINE-000XXX format
   - ✅ Status shows correctly (pending, confirmed, etc.)
   - ✅ Items and prices display correctly

3. **Place a new order**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Complete checkout
   - Go to Order History
   - ✅ New order appears immediately!

---

## 📊 What Should Happen

### Correct Flow

```
1. Customer logs in
   → JWT token with user_id saved
   
2. Customer places order
   → Backend uses JWT.user_id as customer_id
   → Order saved: {_id: "ONLINE-000001", customer_id: JWT.user_id}
   
3. Customer opens Order History
   → Frontend sends JWT token
   → Backend queries: online_transactions.find({customer_id: JWT.user_id})
   → ✅ Orders returned with correct IDs!
```

### What Was Wrong

```
❌ Order created with customer_id: "ABC123"
❌ JWT token contains user_id: "XYZ789"
❌ Backend queries: {customer_id: "XYZ789"}
❌ Result: No orders found (mismatch!)
```

---

## 🚀 After You Fix It

**Your Order History will**:
- ✅ Show new orders immediately
- ✅ Display correct order IDs (ONLINE-XXXXXX)
- ✅ Update status automatically every 30 seconds
- ✅ Show items, prices, and details correctly

**And your customers will**:
- ✅ See their complete order history
- ✅ Track order status in real-time
- ✅ Have a smooth user experience

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If tests still fail, **report back with**:

1. **Screenshot** of test page results
2. **Backend logs** (copy from terminal)
3. **Browser console** errors (F12 → Console tab)
4. **MongoDB** order count:
   ```python
   from backend.app.database import db_manager
   db = db_manager.get_database()
   print("Orders:", db.online_transactions.count_documents({}))
   print("Customers:", db.customers.count_documents({}))
   ```

This will help identify the exact issue!
