# ✅ Alaska Fortified Now Recognized as a Drink!

**Issue:** Alaska Fortified not included in drinks promotion discount  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Date:** October 28, 2025

---

## 🐛 The Problem

"Alaska Fortified" wasn't being recognized as a drink, so:
- ❌ 10% drinks promo didn't apply to it
- ❌ Discount stayed at -₱3.00 even with 4 items
- ❌ Should have been -₱10.80 discount

### Why?

The drink detection only checked for these keywords:
```javascript
// OLD - Missing Alaska!
itemName.includes('drink') || 
itemName.includes('7 up') || 
itemName.includes('bottle') || 
itemName.includes('can') ||
itemName.includes('juice') ||
itemName.includes('soda') ||
itemName.includes('water')
```

**"Alaska Fortified"** doesn't match any of these! ❌

---

## ✅ The Fix

Updated `frontend/src/composables/api/useOnlineOrder.js`:

### 1. **Added Category Checking**
```javascript
// Now checks BOTH category and name
const itemCategory = (item.category || '').toLowerCase()

// Check if category is drinks
if (itemCategory.includes('drink') || itemCategory.includes('beverage')) {
  return true
}
```

### 2. **Expanded Drink Keywords**
```javascript
return itemName.includes('drink') || 
       itemName.includes('7 up') || 
       itemName.includes('bottle') || 
       itemName.includes('can') ||
       itemName.includes('juice') ||
       itemName.includes('soda') ||
       itemName.includes('water') ||
       itemName.includes('alaska') ||  // ✅ ADDED!
       itemName.includes('coke') ||
       itemName.includes('pepsi') ||
       itemName.includes('sprite') ||
       itemName.includes('mountain dew') ||
       itemName.includes('gatorade') ||
       itemName.includes('powerade') ||
       itemName.includes('tea') ||
       itemName.includes('coffee') ||
       itemName.includes('milk')
```

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
```javascript
console.log('🧮 Cart items for discount calculation:', cartItems)
console.log('🧮 Filtered drinks items:', drinksItems)
console.log(`🧮 Item: ${item.name}, Price: ${itemPrice}, Qty: ${itemQty}, Total: ${itemTotal}`)
console.log('🧮 Drinks subtotal:', drinksSubtotal)
console.log('🧮 Drinks discount calculated:', discount)
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Detection Priority:
1. **First:** Check item category (most reliable)
2. **Second:** Check item name for keywords

### Example with Alaska Fortified:

```javascript
Item: "Alaska Fortified"
Category: "Drinks" (or "Beverages")

// Step 1: Check category
itemCategory.includes('drink') // true ✅
// Recognized as drink!

// OR if no category:

// Step 2: Check name
itemName.includes('alaska') // true ✅
// Recognized as drink!
```
