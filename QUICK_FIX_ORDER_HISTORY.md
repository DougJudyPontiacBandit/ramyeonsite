# Quick Fix: Order History Not Showing New Orders

## ⚡ TL;DR

**Problem**: New orders saved to database but don't show in Order History  
**Cause**: `customer_id` mismatch between order creation and retrieval  
**Solution**: Backend now uses JWT token `user_id` for both operations  

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend (`backend/app/kpi_views/online_transaction_views.py`)
- **Line 21-24**: Changed to ALWAYS use JWT token's `user_id` as `customer_id`
- **Added Logging**: Better debug output for tracking orders

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/OrderHistory.vue`)
- **Line 208-220**: Enhanced logging for debugging
- **Line 256-265**: Better feedback when loading orders

## ✅ How to Verify

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
# Run the test script
python test_order_customer_id_consistency.py
```

### 2. Manual Test
1. Log in as a customer
2. Place a new order
3. Navigate to Order History
4. **Order should appear immediately** ✅

### 3. Check Logs

**Browser Console (F12):**
```
✅ Order created successfully
📦 Loading orders from database...
✅ Loaded 1 orders from database
📊 Most recent order: {id: "ONLINE-000001", ...}
```

**Backend Terminal:**
```
📦 Creating order for customer_id: <ID>
✅ Order created successfully: ONLINE-000001 for customer_id: <ID>
📦 Fetching order history for customer_id: <ID>
✅ Fetched 1 orders for customer_id: <ID> (total in DB: 1)
```

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check JWT Token
```javascript
// Browser console
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
console.log('Token:', token);
// Decode at https://jwt.io to see user_id
```

### Check MongoDB
```python
# Django shell
from backend.app.database import db_manager
db = db_manager.get_database()

# Check orders
orders = list(db.online_transactions.find())
print(f"Found {len(orders)} orders")
for o in orders:
    print(f"Order {o['_id']}: customer_id = {o['customer_id']}")

# Check customers
customers = list(db.customers.find())
for c in customers:
    print(f"Customer {c['_id']}: email = {c['email']}")
```

### Verify Match
The `customer_id` in orders MUST match `_id` in customers collection.  
And the JWT token's `user_id` MUST match the customer's `_id`.

## 📁 Files Changed

- `backend/app/kpi_views/online_transaction_views.py`
- `frontend/src/components/OrderHistory.vue`
- `ORDER_HISTORY_SYNC_FIX.md` (documentation)
